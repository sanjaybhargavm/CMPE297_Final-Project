2. Open it in python IDE and run this command: python run app.py

<h3>h. Purpose and Description of the Project</h3>

- House Interior Prediction is one such idea where we need at most in recent times. 


- Now-a-days increase in prices of real-estate and increase in legal issues we are in need of a particular selector to tell whether the interior design is good for the room that or which is selected from internet. 


- To make this solution feasible and simple to use we made this House Interior Prediction.


- Though we have used multiple powerful machine learning models we actually concentrated on transfer learning. 


- Transfer Learning is an approach to select best of multiple features from different model parallelly training with multiple classifiers and regressors. 


- So, tuning the hyperparameters and fusion the model with tensorflow, keras with data that is loaded using pandas and iterated with numpy gave the best and mostly accurate results. 


- We had put those results into one simple and useful interface using flask and distributed those results using performance matrices and F-1 scores.
